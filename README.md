# Desiccation-Responsive Transcriptomic and Proteomic Analysis of *Bryum argenteum*

## Overview

This project investigates the molecular response of *Bryum argenteum* to desiccation stress using RNA-Seq and protein modeling approaches. It integrates transcriptome analysis to identify differentially expressed genes (DEGs) and structural analysis of stress-related proteins, such as LEA proteins.

---

## Objectives

- Identify key genes involved in desiccation tolerance.
- Analyze differential gene expression using RNA-Seq data.
- Perform GO/KEGG enrichment analysis to determine affected pathways.
- Predict and visualize 3D structures of desiccation-related proteins.
